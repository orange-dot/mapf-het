# ROJ-OCPP Federation Demo
#
# Demonstrates OCPP 2.0.1 commands achieving consensus across multiple nodes.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker (for SteVe OCPP CSMS)
#   - Rust toolchain (for building nodes)
#
# Usage:
#   ./ocpp_federation_demo.sh
#

ROJ_BASE_PORT=9990
NODES=("alpha" "beta" "gamma")
STATIONS=("CS001" "CS001" "CS001")  # All represent same station for federation demo
