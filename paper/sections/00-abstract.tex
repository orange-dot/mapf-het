Coordinating heterogeneous robot fleets operating in different dimensional spaces—1D rails, 2D floors, 3D airspace—presents challenges that existing Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) formulations do not address. We introduce Mixed-Dimensional MAPF (MD-MAPF), the first MAPF formulation with a dimensionality function mapping agents to operational spaces and a vertex compatibility function constraining spatial access. We present a six-class dimensional conflict taxonomy (LINEAR, PLANAR, CROSSING, AERIAL, VERTICAL, AIR-GROUND) with specialized resolution strategies achieving 5.6$\times$ speedup over baseline CBS. To bridge planning and execution, we map deadline slack to field components in the EK-KOR2 distributed coordination layer, enabling gradient-based resource allocation that respects planning constraints. Drawing from collective behavior research, we implement $k=7$ topological neighbor coordination that maintains scale-free correlations across 500-2000 module installations, achieving $O(\log N)$ convergence with 42\% CAN-FD bandwidth utilization. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 99.9\% deadline compliance and zero energy violations over 24-hour operational cycles. The implementation comprises 7K lines of Go for planning with dual C/Rust embedded targets for execution.
