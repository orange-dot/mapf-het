## 4. Code Quality Analysis

### 4.1 Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between domain models (core) and algorithms (algo)
2. **Interface Design**: All solvers implement `Solver` interface enabling polymorphism
3. **Deterministic Behavior**: Goal ordering by TaskID ensures reproducibility
4. **Comprehensive Energy Model**: Full battery simulation with recharge support
5. **Time Tolerance**: Proper floating-point comparison with `TimeTolerance = 0.001`
6. **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Go standard library

### 4.2 Areas for Improvement

| Area | Current State | Recommendation |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Test Coverage | 42.7% algo, 3.3% core | Add unit tests for energy calculations |
| Error Handling | Returns nil on failure | Add descriptive error types |
| Logging | None | Add configurable debug logging |
| Instance Validation | Stubbed | Implement full validation |
| STOCHASTIC-ECBS | Returns nil sometimes | Debug probabilistic sampling |

### 4.3 Static Analysis

```
go vet ./...     → Clean (no issues)
go build ./...   → Clean (compiles successfully)
```

## 5. Test Results

### 5.1 Test Summary

```
=== PASS: TestTimeCalculation
=== PASS: TestEdgeConstraintEnforcement
=== PASS: TestMultiGoalAStar
=== PASS: TestSchedulePopulation
=== PASS: TestHoverEnergy
=== PASS: TestSolversMakespanNonZero (Prioritized-HET, CBS-HET, HYBRID-CBS)
=== PASS: TestMultiTaskRobotVisitsAllGoals
=== PASS: TestFindFirstConflict_NoConflict

=== PASS: TestFindFirstConflict_EdgeConflict
=== PASS: TestFindAllConflicts

=== FAIL: TestAllSolversReturnSolution/STOCHASTIC-ECBS
```

### 5.2 Known Issue

**STOCHASTIC-ECBS** returns nil solution on test instances. This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to recent fixes. The algorithm's probabilistic deadline estimation may be too conservative.

## 6. Key Algorithms Deep Dive

### 6.1 Energy-Aware 3D Pathfinding

```go
// SpaceTimeAStar3DWithDurations handles:
// 1. Sequential goal chaining with energy tracking
// 2. Layer transitions through vertical corridors
// 3. Hover energy during task service time
// 4. Constraint validation for wait intervals
// 5. Automatic path failure on energy depletion
```

**Energy Calculation (Fixed)**:
- Horizontal movement: `EnergyForDistance(dist2D, ActionMoveHorizontal)`
- Vertical movement: `EnergyForLayerChange(fromLayer, toLayer)` (separate calculation)
- Hover/wait: `EnergyForTime(duration, ActionHover)`

### 6.2 Conflict Detection (Fixed)

```go
// Edge conflict detection now uses interval overlap:
// For each movement segment pair (seg1, seg2):
//   if seg1.from == seg2.to && seg1.to == seg2.from:  // Opposite directions
//     if intervals [t1_start, t1_end] and [t2_start, t2_end] overlap:
//       return conflict
```

This fixes the bug where edge swaps were missed when robots moved at different speeds.

### 6.3 Deadline-CBS Slack Propagation

```go
// Slack = Deadline - EarliestCompletion
// Conflict selection: Prioritize conflicts involving low-slack robots
// Branching: Order children by remaining slack (tightest first)
// Pruning: Skip nodes where lower bound exceeds deadline
```

## 10. Conclusion

The MAPF-HET research codebase is a well-architected implementation of advanced path planning algorithms. Recent bug fixes have addressed critical issues in:

- Makespan calculation accuracy
- Edge conflict detection with heterogeneous speeds
- Energy simulation for drones
- Constraint enforcement during task service times

The codebase is ready for integration testing with the EK-KOR2 robotic swap station simulator. The one remaining issue (STOCHASTIC-ECBS returning nil) is isolated and does not affect the other 7 solvers.

**Overall Assessment: Production-Ready for Research Use**
